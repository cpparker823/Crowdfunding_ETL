# Crowdfunding_ETL

Our final solutions for the ERD (Project_2_ERD.png) and data extraction pandas notebook file (ETL_Project_2_Final.ipynb) are located in the repository in the Starter_File folder. This folder also contains a Resources folder which holds the output csv files from ETL_Project_2_Final.ipynb, including: campaign.csv, category.csv, contacts.csv, and subcategory.csv. In the Crowdfunding_ETL repository main branch, the file crowdfunding_db.sql is our SQL solution for creating the crowdfunding table schema and relational database in Postgres. 

For this ETL mini project, we worked with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, along with Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we successfully uploaded the CSV file data into our Postgres database.
